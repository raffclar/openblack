/// The commands of the players. The game does not change the world at the time of the player's input. The input makes a
/// command, and the command changes the world at the start of a later game turn. Every player, also the one player of a
/// single game, sends the commands this way, so that all the computers of a network game do the same commands at the
/// same turn.
///
/// The steps of a command:
/// 1. The input puts the command in the open block of its player.
/// 2. Once a frame, after the turns of the frame, the game sends the open block. A block that becomes full is sent at
///    once.
/// 3. At the start of each turn, before the hand's own work of the turn, the game does the commands of all the blocks
///    that it sent, in the order that it sent them. Each command has the number of the player that sent it.
///
/// Thus a command never changes the world in the turn that runs in the same frame step as its input, and the world sees
/// it at the start of the next turn after the send.
